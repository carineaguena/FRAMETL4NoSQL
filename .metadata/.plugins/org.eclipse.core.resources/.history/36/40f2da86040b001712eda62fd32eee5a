from NoSQL_Invetory.SchemaData import SchemaData

#A CF is a collection of columns. These exist in a table.
#Rows are similar to relational rows, except that all rows in the same
#table do not necessarily have the same structure. A value in a cell, i.e.,
#the intersection of a row and a column, is an uninterpreted bit sequence. Each cell
#is versioned, meaning that it can contain multiple versions of the same data and that
#every version has a timestamp attached to it.
